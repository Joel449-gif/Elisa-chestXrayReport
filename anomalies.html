            <h2>Chest X-ray Anomalies</h2>
            <p>Below are the anomalies that can be detected in chest X-rays:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Atelectasis:</strong>
                    <p>Atelectasis refers to the collapse or incomplete expansion of the lung or a portion of the lung. It can be caused by various factors, including airway obstruction, lung scarring, or compression of the lung tissue. Atelectasis may appear as areas of increased opacity on a chest X-ray.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consolidation:</strong>
                    <p>Consolidation occurs when lung tissue becomes filled with fluid, pus, blood, or other substances. This can be indicative of pneumonia or other respiratory infections. On a chest X-ray, consolidation appears as areas of increased density in the lungs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Edema:</strong>
                    <p>Pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid in the air sacs of the lungs. It can be caused by heart failure, kidney failure, or damage to the lung tissue. On a chest X-ray, pulmonary edema appears as increased fluid in the lung fields, often with a "bat-wing" or "butterfly" pattern.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emphysema:</strong>
                    <p>Emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by damage to the air sacs in the lungs. This damage leads to difficulty breathing and reduced lung function. On a chest X-ray, emphysema may appear as hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms and increased lung transparency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fibrosis:</strong>
                    <p>Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease characterized by scarring and thickening of the lung tissue. It can be caused by various factors, including exposure to toxins, certain medications, or autoimmune diseases. On a chest X-ray, pulmonary fibrosis appears as areas of increased opacity or "ground glass" appearance in the lungs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Effusion:</strong>
                    <p>Pleural effusion is the buildup of fluid in the pleural space, the space between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity. It can be caused by infections, heart failure, cancer, or other conditions. On a chest X-ray, pleural effusion appears as a white shadow around the lung edges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pleural Thickening:</strong>
                    <p>Pleural thickening refers to the thickening and hardening of the pleural membranes, which surround the lungs and line the chest cavity. It can be caused by asbestos exposure, infections, or other lung diseases. On a chest X-ray, pleural thickening appears as irregular, white lines along the lung edges.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cardiomegaly:</strong>
                    <p>Cardiomegaly is an enlargement of the heart, often due to heart conditions such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or high blood pressure. On a chest X-ray, cardiomegaly appears as an enlarged heart silhouette, typically with a cardiothoracic ratio greater than 0.5.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mass:</strong>
                    <p>A lung mass refers to an abnormal growth or tumor in the lung tissue. Lung masses can be benign or malignant (cancerous). On a chest X-ray, a lung mass appears as a localized area of increased opacity or a distinct nodule.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hernia:</strong>
                    <p>A diaphragmatic hernia occurs when abdominal organs protrude through a defect in the diaphragm and enter the chest cavity. It can be congenital (present from birth) or acquired due to trauma or surgery. On a chest X-ray, a diaphragmatic hernia may appear as abdominal organs above the diaphragm.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lung Opacity:</strong>
                    <p>Lung opacity refers to any abnormal area of increased density or opacity in the lungs. It can be caused by various conditions, including pneumonia, tumors, or fluid accumulation. On a chest X-ray, lung opacity appears as areas of whiteness that may obscure normal lung markings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enlarged Cardiomegaly:</strong>
                    <p>An enlarged mediastinum refers to an abnormal enlargement of the area in the middle of the chest that contains the heart, major blood vessels, and other structures. It can be caused by various conditions, including heart enlargement, tumors, or inflammation. On a chest X-ray, an enlarged mediastinum appears as an abnormal widening of the mediastinal silhouette.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
